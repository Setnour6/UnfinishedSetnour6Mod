This is the return of the 1.3 mod, and my first ever mod, Unfinished Setnour6 Mod.

This mod has been made and published for testing reasons, but also for better gear that combines certain vanilla items.

This is an incomplete mod, but that's okay.

~ With love from Setnour6.

~~~~~~

Version 0.2.1.0 (Current Version):
- Added "Zenith"???.
	- "Zenith" does not act/function like the actual Zenith from 1.4, but it does something related to it.
- Added "Static Wings", which grants 10 seconds of flight with huge speed and acceleration.
	- "Static Wings" will require "Celestial's Particle" for crafting (If AlchemistNPC Mod is enabled) 
- "Statical Essence" now has a guaranteed chance of dropping from the Dungeon Guardian.
	- Note that the Moon Lord already drops 1 "Statical Essence" at a guaranteed rate.
- Gave "Blue Potion" a unique rarity (original rarity set to 9 for consistency).
- Slight adjustments to "Statical Essence".
- "Orange Static" is now easier to see.

Version 0.2.0.0:
- Renamed the mod, now named "Setnour6's Mod (Unfinished)" Instead of "UnfinishedSetnour6Mod". (The internal mod name is kept the same)
- Added "Green Static".
- Added "Black Static", but is unobtainable through normal gameplay.
- Added a new item drop: "Statical Essence". Can be obtained by defeating the Moon Lord. Required to craft all of the static accessories, excluding "Black Static".
- Added "Blue Potion", which grants immunity to almost all vanilla debuffs... hopefully, along with it's own buff, simply called "Blue Potion" or "Blue Potion Buff".
- Tooltip adjustments to all "Tutorial Swords".
- Slight tooltip adjustments to "White Static".
- "White Static" defense greatly nerfed and life regen slightly nerfed.
- "White Static" now requires the spore sac and lava waders to be crafted.
